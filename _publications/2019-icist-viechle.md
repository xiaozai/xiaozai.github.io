## Abstract
A number of spatially-localised semantic parts of vehicles sensitive to pose changes are encoded their visible probabilities into a mid-level feature vector. Car pose estimation is then formulated into a regression on concatenated low- and mid- level features to continuously changing viewing angles. Each dimension of our visibility-aware part codes separates all the training samples into two groups according to its visual existence in images, which provides additional part-specific range constraint of viewing angles. Moreover, the proposed codes can alleviate the suffering from sparse and imbalanced data distribution in the light of modelling latent dependency across angle targets. Experimental evaluation for car pose estimation on the EPFL Multi-View Car benchmark demonstrates significant improvement of our method over the state-of-the-art regression methods, especially when only sparse and imbalanced data is available.
