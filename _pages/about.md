I am a Second-Year PhD Student at Department of Computing, Tampere University under the supervision of Prof. Joni-Kristian Kämäräinen at the Computer Vison Group.

I received B.E. degree from Department of Software Engineering, Sichuan University in June, 2015, and Master's degree from Department of Information Technology, Communication Systems and Networks, Tampere University of Technology in August, 2017.

As an enthusiastic researcher, my goal is to combine state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms with real-life industrial problems. I am currently solving problems of human body reconstruction, pose and shape estimation.
